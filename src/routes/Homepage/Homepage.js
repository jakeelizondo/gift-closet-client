          Must go faster. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat
          lady! Drive us out of here! You're a very talented young man, with
          your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Jaguar
          shark! So tell me - does it really exist? This thing comes fully
          loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.
          Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Yeah, but your
          scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they
          didn't stop to think if they should. Must go faster. Life finds a way.
          God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Must go faster... go,
          go, go, go, go!
